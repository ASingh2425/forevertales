## 📸 Majestic Themes & Watermarks
TellATale uses a unique "Theme Engine" that injects SVG watermarks into the background based on your selection. When you switch to DC Comics, a subtle Bat-signal appears; switching to Marvel reveals a holographic Shield. This ensures the UI is as immersive as the story itself.
